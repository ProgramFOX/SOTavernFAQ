    <h2>What is The SO Tavern?</h2>
    <p>
        It's a chat room on <a href="http://chat.stackoverflow.com">Stack Overflow chat</a> (one of the first to ever be created). You can find it <a href="http://chat.stackoverflow.com/rooms/5">here</a>.
    </p>
    <h2>What is the room's topic?</h2>
    <p>
        The topic of the room is (generally) rather diverse. Both general programming and meta-discussion about Stack Overflow are on-topic, and discussion about other subjects - such as chess - are also allowed.
    </p>
    <h2>What is "EditMonitor"?</h2>
    <p>
        <a href="https://github.com/ProgramFOX/SO-EditMonitor">EditMonitor</a> is a chatbot that runs in the room. It looks at recent suggested edits and reports them in the room of something looks wrong, for example: approved with 2 rejection votes, a link in the comment (usually spam), etc..
    </p>
    <h2>Who are the room owners, and how can I contact them?</h2>
    <p>
        <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/2619912">ProgramFOX</a>, <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/3622940">Unihedron</a> and <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/2246344">Sam</a> are the current room owners. To contact them, simply "ping" (one or all of) them from within the room by simply adding an "<code>@</code>" in front of their name in your message (e.g., "<code>@ProgramFOX Hello!</code>").
    </p>
    <h2>Which language do I have to speak here?</h2>
    <p>
        The room is an English-speaking room. Please try to use correct grammar and spelling, and avoid "text speak". Well-known acronyms (such as <abbr title="If I Remember Correctly">IIRC</abbr>, <abbr title="As Far As I Know">AFAIK</abbr>, ...) are fine.
